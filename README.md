Matrix Exponential Random Number Generator for NS-3

Note: Some of the programs here require the Eigen3 library.  This can be downloaded at:  https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html

The Eigen files need to be installed in the include directory.  I used /usr/local/include/ on my local linux machine.  But, you could probably use the project directory or an NS-3 specific include directory.
